# A HYBRID MACHINE LEARNING MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE INCIDENCE OF DIABETES MELLITUS IN ZIMBABWE

The incidence of diabetes mellitus is a significant public health concern in Zimbabwe, and accurate estimation of its prevalence is crucial for effective healthcare planning and resource allocation. Traditional statistical methods have not been sufficient to capture the full range of risk factors associated with the disease and predict incidence accurately. This research developed a hybrid machine learning model that combines multiple algorithms, such as regression and classification models, to provide a more comprehensive and accurate estimation of diabetes incidence by analysing the complex relationships between various risk factors. An analysis of comprehensive Zimbabwean dataset reveals that high glucose levels, BMI, age, and pregnancies, are highly correlated with a positive result of diabetes mellitus. The model was trained and evaluated using rigorous validation techniques to ensure its robustness and generalizability. The average accuracy for the suggested hybrid machine learning model was 81.9%, indicating its effectiveness in estimating diabetes incidence. The model can be deployed as a tool for estimating diabetes incidence in real-world scenarios, supporting healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers in understanding the disease's risk factors. The insights gained from this research can have significant implications for public health initiatives, early detection, and effective management of diabetes mellitus in Zimbabwe and potentially other similar populations worldwide.
